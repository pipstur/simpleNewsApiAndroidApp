# simpleNewsApiAndroidApp
Simple NewsApi android app for the Serbian region written in Java.  

It works fine, looks great and there are a couple of features. 

3 categories, you can go into the individual articles and read them with the webViewer, pretty neato.  

Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly since newsApi doesn't always grab the most relevant information in accordance to the selected category. 
Perhaps that is just because it doesn't have that many Serbia localized articles to get.
